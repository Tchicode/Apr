    <h1>Celebrations and Observances in April</h1>
    <div class="columns3">
        <h2>Buddha's Birthday</h2>
    
        <p>Buddha's birthday is said to be in the month of April. He was born in Nepal and
        his birthday is referred to as Purnima. Purnima is the first full moon and is a time to
        celebrate Gurus and Teachers. Buddha is strongly associated with enlightenment.

    <div class="columns3">
         <h2>Easter</h2>
    
        <p>Another major celebration, that is often in April, is Easter.  Easter is commercially
        associated with colorful eggs and bunny rabbits.  What easter really represents is the 
        sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christ is associated with forgiveness, love
        and rebirth.

    </div>
    
    <div class="columns3">
    <h2>Passover</h2>
        
        <p>Still, another major celebration often in April is Passover. What is it about April?
        Passover commemorates the ending of bondage of enslaved Israelites, under 
        the protection and guidance of a man named Moses. Moses was born of a enslaved mother, but raised
        as royalty. Passover is often associated with being freed and having help in high 
        places.
