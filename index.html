    <h2>The Month of April</h2>    
    
        <div class="opening">
    <p>April is associated with the season spring, in the northern hemisphere. The word April is derived from the latin word aprilis or aperire, which means open. Flowers begin to bloom or open. Dasies(bellis perennis) are the flower for the month of April. They are sometimes nicknamed, day's eye. Even though, white dasies represent friendship, you can still play "he loves me, he loves me not".  Daisies are related to sunflowers and are resilient. They can survive almost anywhere. Suprisingly, this delicate flower can be used to treat wounds or worn as a necklace. Maybe, being two flowers in one, makes daisies beautiful and strong.

        <p>Some ancient belief systems, believed the month of April 
            belonged, to Aphrodite, also known as Venus, the Goddess 
            of Love. I'm reminded of my first college writing assignment. 
            The assignment involved, finding a tree or flower bud and 
            notating the changes over a four week period. Something funny
            happened. I always thought of spring as life or new life. When 
            my delicate flower bud bloomed, only to die and be replaced, 
            by ordinary green leaves, I felt grief. I wonder, would I
            appreciate flowers as much, if they were in bloom year round.
            The opening line to my college paper was: Spring must be a 
            sensual woman (gimme a break, I was 18). I never knew the 
            Goddess of Love owned April.

        <h2>So Does...</h2>
        <div class="daismon">
        <p>Love + Showers = Flowers or Showers + Flowers = Love? Its good to know the flowers return and the diamonds remain. They say, diamonds are forever. Diamonds are sometimes, called: "a rock", "bling" or "ice", no matter what you call diamonds, most would love to have one. Whether a marriage proposal or wedding anniversary, you are nearly guaranteed to get a diamond, if you were born in April because diamonds are your birthstone.
